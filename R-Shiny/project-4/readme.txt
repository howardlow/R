The purpose of this project is to demostrate the following:
1. learning the caret style of thinking about model optimisation and selection 
2. performing hyper-parameter optimisation through cross validation
3. using parallel processing for cross validation of model types that support this
4. producing a set of candidate models appropriate to the data
5. selecting the best model using an unbiased measures
6. quantifying the performance of the best model
